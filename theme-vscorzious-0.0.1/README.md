### **About v0.0.1**
VSCorzious v0.0.1 is a dark GUI and Editor colour theme for Visual Studio Code that mainly focuses on fast and easy recognition while still being easy on the eyes.

### **Supported Languages**
I have mainly focused on developing this theme for the following languages but most languages should be working just fine. If they are not make sure to send feedback on my Github repository and I'll make sure to work on them.

* HTML 
* CSS
* SCSS 
* JS
* Elixir
* json
* More Coming

### **Future Plans**
First I want to make sure everyone is enjoying the theme and that most languages are supported properly.

#### Light Theme
If people are enjoying this theme I would love to hear so and if there is demand I'll also work on a light theme.

#### Icon Theme
I am also planning on developing my own icon theme when I get the chance, which will most likely be after developing a light theme and support for more languages.

Personally I am using "VSCode Great Icons" which I am enjoying very much and I believe work very well with this theme. 

I do not own VSCode Great Icons and all credit goes to Emmanuel BÃ©ziat.
